        <h1>Dish: French Macarons</h1>
        <p>About This Dish</p><br>
        <p>Macarons and macaroons are two completely different cookies. 
            Macaroons have an extra O in the name and are coconut cookies. 
            Macarons are delicate sandwich cookies. Here are my coconut macaroons. 
            See the difference? Though they are both cookies made with egg whites, 
            they are much different.</p><br>
        <p>They are both, however, gluten free dessert recipes.</p><br>
        <p>What Do These French Macarons Taste Like?</p><br>
        <p>French macarons are delicate sandwich cookies with a crisp exterior. 
            Each individual cookie is known as a macaron shell. 
            The shells are made without any chemical leaveners and get all of 
            their lift from properly beaten egg whites. If you follow the recipe carefully, 
            the cookies have a unique nougat-like, chewy texture. They should not be hollow. 
            You can flavor macarons many ways, but this recipe is for plain macarons. 
            They taste like sweet almond—and they’re delicious! You can always have fun with 
            different flavorful fillings such as vanilla buttercream, lemon buttercream, salted caramel,
             or chocolate ganache.</p><br>
             <p>If there’s one thing to know before baking French macarons at home, it’s this: 
                these cookies require precision, patience, and practice. 
                I’m going to do my best to prepare any French macaron beginner. You can do this!</p><br>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ul>
                <ol>Wipe down a large glass or metal mixing bowl with lemon juice or vinegar. 
                    Add egg whites. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours, then bring to room temperature.</ol>
                <ol>Line 3 large baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. Set aside.</ol>
                <ol> Add cream of tartar and extract (if using) to egg whites. 
                    Using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat together on medium speed until very soft peaks form. 
                    This takes a few minutes of beating. At first the egg white and cream of tartar mixture will be foamy, 
                    then the bubbles will begin to tighten and the beaters will leave tracks as the egg whites build volume. 
                    Once they begin leaving tracks, you likely have soft peaks. Stop beating. Add about 1/3 of the superfine sugar. 
                    Beat on medium-high speed for 5 seconds, then with the mixer continuing to run, add another 1/3 of the sugar. 
                    Beat for 5 seconds, then with the mixer continuing to run, add the remaining sugar. Beat on medium-high speed until stiff glossy peaks form. 
                    (This means the whites have stiff, smooth, and sharp points in the bowl or on the lifted whisk attachment/beaters. Stiff peaks do not droop down. 
                    You can turn the bowl upside down and the egg whites will not move or spill out.) Using a rubber spatula, slowly and gently fold the food coloring (if using) into the egg whites.</ol>
                <ol> Sift the almond flour and confectioners’ sugar together in a large glass or metal mixing bowl. Use a spoon to help work any larger pieces through the sieve. 
                    You don’t want to discard a lot of that because then you won’t have enough dry ingredients in the batter.</ol>
                <ol>Slowly fold the beaten egg whites into the almond flour mixture in 3 separate additions, folding until combined before adding the next addition. 
                    After you add all of the egg whites, pay very close attention to the consistency of your macaron batter. Continue folding the batter (which deflates air) 
                    until it thins out into the consistency of honey. What’s a more helpful cue is the figure 8 test. 
                    Drop the macaron batter off of your spatula in the form of a figure 8. 
                    The figure 8 should take no more than 10 seconds to sink back into itself. 
                    If it takes less, your batter was overmixed and is too thin. If it takes longer, continue slowly folding the batter to deflate more air, then perform the figure 8 test again. 
                    It’s best to go very slow so you don’t accidentally overmix.
                </ol>
                <ol>Spoon the macaron batter into a piping bag fitted with a medium round piping tip, such as Wilton 12, Wilton 1A, or even Ateco 806. The macaron batter is very drippy, 
                    so transferring to the piping bag can be messy.</ol>
                <ol> Holding the piping bag at a 90 degree angle over the baking sheet, pipe batter in 1.5 – 2 inch rounds about 1-2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. I usually pipe little mounds—see video tutorial above. 
                    The piped macaron batter flattens out. Bang the pan a couple times on the counter to pop any air bubbles, then use a toothpick to pop any remaining air bubbles.</ol>
                <ol>Let the piped macarons sit out until they are dry and no longer tacky on top, usually 30-60 minutes. This time allows the top to firm up and form a skin, 
                    which helps the macarons rise UP and form their trademark ruffly “feet.” 
                    Do not let them sit out for longer than they need to because they could begin to deflate.</ol>
                <ol>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C).</ol>
                <ol>Bake for 13 minutes. As the macaron shells bake, they should form feet. To test for doneness, lightly touch the top of a macaron with a spoon or your finger (careful, it’s hot). 
                    If the macaron seems wobbly, it’s not done and needs another 1-2 minutes. If it seems set, it’s done. Basically, bake until the macarons don’t move around when touched.</ol>
                <ol>Let the shells cool on the baking sheet for 15 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to continue cooling. The macaron shells may stick to the parchment paper/baking sheet if you try to remove them too early. If this is happening, let them cool on the baking sheet a little longer before removing.</ol>
                <ol>After cooling, the shells are ready to fill and sandwich together. I have plenty of filling suggestions in the recipe notes below. You can spread filling with a knife or pipe it using the same round tip you used for the macaron batter.</ol>
                <ol>You can eat right away or, as some professionals prefer, cover and refrigerate them 12-24 hours so the macarons and flavors can mature. Bring to room temperature before serving. (I usually just serve them right away!)</ol>
                <ol> Cover leftover macarons and refrigerate for up to 5 days.</ol>

            <h2>Additional Info</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Freezing Instructions: </strong> macaron shells and finished assembled macarons can be frozen for up to 1 month. Thaw at room temperature before filling/serving.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Tools (affiliate links): </strong> Mixer (Handheld or Stand) | Glass Mixing Bowls or Metal Mixing Bowls | Egg Separator | Food Scale | Fine Mesh Sieve | Piping Bag (Disposable or Reusable) | Medium-Round Piping Tip (Wilton 12, Wilton 1A, or Ateco 806) | Baking Sheets | Silicone Baking Mat, Macaron-Specific Silicone Baking Mat, or Parchment Paper | Cooling Rack</li>
                <li><strong>Ingredient Substitutions & Weights:</strong> I do not recommend any ingredient substitutions in this recipe. Using weights (and a food scale) is the best way to guarantee success. However if you do not own one, use the following approximate measurements: for the superfine sugar, use 1/3 cup. For the almond flour and confectioners’ sugar, you need about 1 cup + 1 teaspoon each.</li>
                <li><strong>Egg Whites:</strong> For best and most consistent results, I strongly recommend using fresh egg whites instead of liquid egg whites from a carton.</li>
                <li><strong>Extract/Flavoring:</strong> I keep these macarons plain. Without flavoring, they have a sweet almond flavor. However, if desired, feel free to add 1/2 teaspoon of your favorite extract such as almond, vanilla, coconut, lemon, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Make Your Own Superfine Sugar: </strong>Add 80g of regular granulated sugar to your food processor or blender. Pulse about 10-15x until granules are much finer, aka superfine sugar. Weigh 80g superfine sugar—should be about the same amount you started with.</li>
                <li><strong>Optional Food Coloring:</strong> Tinting macaron batter is completely optional. If you don’t tint it, the macarons will be a natural beige color. Avoid using liquid food coloring because it will change the consistency of your macaron batter. Instead, use 1-2 drops of gel food coloring. (I used dusty rose, aqua, and fuchsia.) Powder food coloring should be fine, but I haven’t tested it. Only use a very small amount.</li>
                <li><strong>Almond Flour:</strong> Make sure you use almond flour, not almond meal. It is usually labeled as “fine” almond flour. Almond flour is much finer than almond meal and made from blanched, skinless almonds. Almond meal is coarser and contains almond skin. You can make your own almond flour, but be very careful because almonds can quickly release their oils, clump up, and turn into almond butter. It might be easier to just pick up a bag of fine almond flour. It’s very common in mostly all grocery stores these days– I use and love Bob’s Red Mill brand.</li>
